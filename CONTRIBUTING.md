# Contributing to PFControl

Contributions are welcome!

- Fork the repo and open a pull request (to the preview branch so it can be tested on https://canary.pfconnect.online).
- Follow the existing code style.
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run format` before submitting.
- For larger changes, open an issue first to discuss.

If you're adding features that require environment variables, update `.env.example` and document them in this README.
